# D7A_Bird_Dash
you need to install a few libraries, dash, numpy, sklearn and pandas.
Not sure if there are more, but youll find out when you run it.
basic syntax to install is: `pip install dash`

Ive included the datasets, only `finalbirdsSEM4` and `birdsNewLinks` are used.

Use the project tab to keep track of what we need to implement and your current progress.
