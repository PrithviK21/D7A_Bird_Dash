# D7A_Bird_Dash
Repository with all the random bird files, python and all

you need to install a few libraries, dash and pandas.
Not sure if there are more, but youll find out when you run it lol.
basic syntax to install is: `pip install dash`

This is the practice file, just a few options.

Ive included the datasets, only `final_birds_fixed_dates.csv` has the dd/mm/yyyy format, the rest are all dd/mon/yyyy
